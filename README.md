Run something like `cloaca do "fix my type errors` and the agent will attempt to understand the issue, read the relevant code, figure out the fix, apply a patch to your files, checkout a fresh git branch and commit the changes. You'll be able to step in with assistance or confirmations at various stages to help guide the process.
